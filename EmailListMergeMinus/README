  --merge MERGE  The CSV file to merge email addresses from
  --minus MINUS  The CSV file to minus email addresses of
  --print        Print the state file


Given a specified STATE json file the mergeminums.py program either
- merges email addresses from a MERGE file into the STATE file
- removes email addresses from a MINUS file from the STATE file
- prints email addresses in the STATE file

MERGE and MINUS files must be CSV files with a first row containing case insensitive columns names,
including "First name", "Last name", and "Email" columns. Other columns are ignored.

The STATE file is in JSON format. If it doesn't exist it is initialized.
